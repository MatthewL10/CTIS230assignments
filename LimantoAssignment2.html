    <h3>Matthew: Highlights</h3>
    <p>
      <strong
        >We are Team 731, Wannabee Strange from Greensboro NC, names. This
        season, Team 731 tries to embody the theme of FIRST and help make STEM
        more accessible in our state. Wannabee Strange carries out gracious
        professionalism in every aspect of our endeavors while also striving for
        success within our season. This season, we’d like to highlight our main
        outreach goals of increasing STEM accessibility, encoders and gyro based
        functions, and the extensive application of CAD in designing custom
        parts to CNC machine and 3d print to help our robot tackle this year’s
        challenge.

    <h3>Tajreean: Preseason/Outreach</h3>
    <p>
      This season, 731 as a team has committed over 200 hours solely towards
      increasing the awareness of STEM in the local community. Our main
      activities include interviews with an FTC coach from Orange County, and
      with AGGIES mentors from NC A&T’s STEM department. We also did robot
      demonstrations at local schools like Greensboro Academy, and Greensboro
      Montessori where students drove our robot around, and also learned about
      robot design through TinkerCAD tutorials. These demonstrations and
      activities not only allowed us to gain recognition from local
      administrators and FIRST ambassadors, but to kickstart our goal of
      increasing the accessibility of STEM as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Victoria</h3>
    <p>
      As we watched students’ faces light up at each of our events, we realized
      that these kinds of experiences are not available to everyone due to a
      lack of funding for STEM education, especially at Title 1 Schools. Title 1
      schools are the most economically challenged schools in the region, and as
      many of our team members come from a Title 1 middle school, this is a
      cause that is very close our hearts. In order to take steps towards
      turning this around, we reached out to some of these schools—like the
      Academy at Lincoln and North Elementary School—to help them get more
      funding and mentorship to facilitate STEM education through robotics. The
      Academy at Lincoln has already reached out to us, requesting additional
      mentorship and presentations for their FLL teams.
    </p>
    <h3>Zoya</h3>
    <p>
      To further strengthen our initiative, we reached out to Dr. Kory Bennett
      to help sponsor these programs at these schools, and are looking forward
      towards working with him. We are also bringing back our FIRST Initiative
      from 2020 by re-distributing the template flyers containing legislator
      connections, template emails, and outreach tips for teams and schools to
      share with their legislators and gain funding outside of our area. Through
      this, we can share resources with schools AND robotics teams to increase
      funding, catering towards technical and nontechnical communities.
    </p>
    <h3>Colin: Ri24h / Kickoff</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Kickoff</strong><br />
      At kickoff, 5 of our members did an Intro to Drivetrains presentation and
      a Marketing: Make It Loud presentation. Ideas in 24 hours Right after
      kickoff, we got lunch as a team and then went to our workspace to grab
      parts before heading to Zain’s house to begin prototyping and
      strategizing. Using a pre-built tank drivetrain, we tested a couple
      different intakes and outtake mechanisms like linear slides, and
      prototyped a cardboard bucket for our transfer mechanism.
