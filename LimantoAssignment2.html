<Strong>Order:</Strong> Matthew, Tajreen, Victoria, Zoya, Colin, Zain, Robbie, Azreen, Sonia

<h3>Matthew: Highlights</h3>
<p><strong>We are Team 731, Wannabee Strange from Greensboro NC, names. 
This season, Team 731 tries to embody the theme of FIRST and help make STEM more accessible in our state. Wannabee Strange carries out gracious professionalism in every aspect of our endeavors while also striving for success within our season. This season, we’d like to highlight our main outreach goals of increasing STEM accessibility, encoders and gyro based functions, and the extensive application of CAD in designing custom parts to CNC machine and 3d print to help our robot tackle this year’s challenge. 
</strong></p>
<h3>Tajreean: Preseason/Outreach </h3>
<p>This season, 731 as a team has committed over 200 hours solely towards increasing the awareness of STEM in the local community. Our main activities include interviews with an FTC coach from Orange County, and with AGGIES mentors from NC A&T’s STEM department. We also did robot demonstrations at local schools like Greensboro Academy, and Greensboro Montessori where students drove our robot around, and also learned about robot design through TinkerCAD tutorials. These demonstrations and activities not only allowed us to gain recognition from local administrators and FIRST ambassadors, but to kickstart our goal of increasing the accessibility of STEM as well. 
</p>
<h3>Victoria</h3>
<p>As we watched students’ faces light up at each of our events, we realized that these kinds of experiences are not available to everyone due to a lack of funding for STEM education, especially at Title 1 Schools. Title 1 schools are the most economically challenged schools in the region, and as many of our team members come from a Title 1 middle school, this is a cause that is very close our hearts. In order to take steps towards turning this around, we reached out to some of these schools—like the Academy at Lincoln and North Elementary School—to help them get more funding and mentorship to facilitate STEM education through robotics. The Academy at Lincoln has already reached out to us, requesting additional mentorship and presentations for their FLL teams.
</p>
<h3>Zoya</h3>
<p>
To further strengthen our initiative, we reached out to Dr. Kory Bennett to help sponsor these programs at these schools, and are looking forward towards working with him. We are also bringing back our FIRST Initiative from 2020 by re-distributing the template flyers containing legislator connections, template emails, and outreach tips for teams and schools to share with their legislators and gain funding outside of our area. Through this, we can share resources with schools AND robotics teams to increase funding, catering towards technical and nontechnical communities.

<h3>Colin: Ri24h / Kickoff</h3>
<p><strong>Kickoff</strong><br>
At kickoff, 5 of our members did an Intro to Drivetrains presentation and a Marketing: Make It Loud presentation.
Ideas in 24 hours
Right after kickoff, we got lunch as a team and then went to our workspace to grab parts before heading to Zain’s house to begin prototyping and strategizing.
Using a pre-built tank drivetrain, we tested a couple different intakes and outtake mechanisms like linear slides, and prototyped a cardboard bucket for our transfer mechanism.
</p>
<h3>Matthew: CAD / CNC</h3>
<p><strong>
We designed a lot of custom parts using PTC Creo and were able to use our Openbuilds WORKBEE CNC Machine to machine our parts, including our box tube drivetrain and boxtube scoring arm. With it we were able to accurately cut a sleek low profile design utilizing the hollow nature of 1/16 inch box tube to mount our motors. We also 3d printed many parts in order to create both strong and lightweight components for our gripper.
Zain: Drivetrain and scoring mechanism
This season we used a 6 wheel tank drivetrain since we found that the acceleration and reliability of a tank drive was more important in this game than the third degree of freedom that mecanum wheels grant. The pulleys were also printed larger so that the belts can act as treads while driving over the barrier.
We have a pass-through scoring design, in which our surgical tubing intake grabs the freight and feeds it straight into our double axis ….. This design allows us to use our arm to score in every position on the alliance hubs, as well as cycle the shared hub, and cap team scoring elements. We also implemented magnets in order to score a more wide range of team shipping elements.

<h3>Robbie: Programming</h3>
<p>
Our goal this season in terms of programming is to have easy to understand, readable code. In order to more closely integrate programming with the mechanics of the robot, we are working towards automating teleOp functions and using gyro-based movements to increase accuracy. Also, to increase the adaptability of our robot, we’ve implemented manual driver controls in teleOp.
Azreen: Programming
In TeleOp, we aim to ease driver ergonomics by automating certain movements including closing our gripper when intaking blocks and spheres, and automating arm movements based on Xstates and timers. To aid driver comfort, we’ve implemented auto braking to prevent sliding on the field, as well as splitting TeleOp into red and blue classes to optimize the duck carousel subsystem.
Sonia: More Programming LOL Nerds shut up pay attention  
In terms of auto this year, we are using encoderDrive to make our robot’s movements smooth and precise. Along with this, we’ve implemented Gyro based turning functions within our autonomous to essentially have our robot self-correct minor errors and continue on its target path. To further aid smooth movement with our tank drivetrain, we implemented a trapezoid curve for our speed, so the robot's movements are not jerky. This has minimal effect on the overall time needed to run our auto, so it’s preferable.
</p>
<h3>Ayaam/Sonia: Conclusion</h3>
<p></p>
This season we exemplify gracious professionalism by making robotics more accessible in our community. It’s the secret ingredient in our recipe for inspiring other teams. By connecting with people not only in the robotics community but also beyond, we strive to embody FIRST in everything we do.
